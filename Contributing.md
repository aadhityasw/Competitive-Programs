# Contributing

Before we get started with the technical details, Thank You for taking time to visit here. Whether you are willing to contribute to this repository, or are here to get the setup running on your local machine, this is the right place for that. So lets get started :)


## Setting up the Repository

Our first task would be to get the code in this repository onto your computer in order for you to start working easily. In order to simplify this process and to make it generic, I have used a few tools to keep this process the same for all, but there might be some errors or warnings in the process, so be ready to google them.

In case you do not have an Github account, go ahead and create one at [github.com](https://github.com). With this done head back to [this repository](https://github.com/aadhityasw/Competitive-Programs). If you are new to github, take some time to explore the options and the concepts related to git, version control, etc.

In order for you to modify the code from this repository and make your own changes, we would essentially `fork` my version of the repository into one which resides in your account, and you can make your changes there. Once you have made your changes and wish to observe those changes in this main repository, you would raise a `pull request`, but more on this later.

### Forking the Repository

1. Head over to the root repository, available [here](https://github.com/aadhityasw/Competitive-Programs).
2. Make sure, you are signed in into your account. Now click on the `Fork` option available there, and choose your account if served with a list of all organizations you are a part of.
3. Now you will be able to notice that the repository in fromt of you, would have `<YOUR_USER_NAME>/Competitive-Programs`. This is your forked version of the repository, and you can make any changes here without affecting the main repository.


### Installing Softwares

1. Install [Github Desktop]() in your computer which would also install git along with it. I would also suggest to install [vs-code]() code editor, as the development container
2. 


### Cloning your fork

You have now forked to make your own version of the repository, now you would just have to `clone` your forked version onto your computer to start working.

1. Click on the `Code` button from your forked version of the repository and
