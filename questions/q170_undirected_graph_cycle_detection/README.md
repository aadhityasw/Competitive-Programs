# Detect cycle in an undirected graph


https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-an-undirected-graph/1/


Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. 

Example 1:

Input:   

Output: 1
Explanation: 1->2->3->4->1 is a cycle.
Example 2:

Input: 

Output: 0
Explanation: No cycle in the graph.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isCycle() which takes V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns a boolean value denoting if the undirected graph contains any cycle or not.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Space Complexity: O(V)
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 10^5
