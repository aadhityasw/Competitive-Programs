# Detect cycle in a directed graph


https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph/1#


Given a Directed Graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.


Example 1:

Input:



Output: 1
Explanation: 3 -> 3 is a cycle

Example 2:

Input:


Output: 0
Explanation: no cycle in the graph

Your task:
You don’t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isCyclic() which takes the integer V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns a boolean value denoting if the given directed graph contains a cycle or not.


Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V)


Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 10^5
