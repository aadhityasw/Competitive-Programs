First argument is an integer A.

Second argument is an integer B.

Third argument is an integer C.

Fourth argument is an integer D.



Output Format
Return an array of size D denoting the first smallest D integers which only have A, B, C or a combination of them as their prime factors.

NOTE: You need to return the array sorted in ascending order.

 A = 2
 B = 3
 C = 5
 D = 5


Example Output
Output 1:

 [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
