# Largest subsquare surrounded by X


https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-subsquare-surrounded-by-x0558/1/



Given a matrix A of dimensions NxN where every element is either ‘O’ or ‘X’. Find the largest subsquare surrounded by ‘X’.

Example 1:

Input:
N=2
A=[[X,X][X,X]]
Output:
2
Explanation:
The largest square submatrix 
surrounded by X is the whole 
input matrix.
Example 2:

Input:
N=4
A=[[X,X,X,O],[X,O,X,X],
[X,X,X,O],[X,O,X,X]]
Output:
3
Explanation:
Here,the input represents following 
matrix of size 4 x 4
X X X O
X O X X
X X X O
X O X X
The square submatrix starting at 
(0,0) and ending at (2,2) is the 
largest submatrix surrounded by ‘X’.
Therefore, size of that matrix would be 3.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function largestSubsquare() which takes the integer N and the matrix A as input parameters and returns the size of the largest subsquare surrounded by 'X'.


Expected Time Complexity:O(N^2)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(N^2)


Constraints:
1<=N<=1000
A[i][j]={'X','O'}
